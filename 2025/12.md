# Ethereum

Modified: 250208

not only a block-chain based cybercurrency, but a turing-complete programming language  
bitcoin could refer as a state-transition system  

problems in bitcoin scripting: lack of Turing completeness, no value-blindness, lack of state  
in ethereum, people built a meta-security layer on top of bitcoin tech-stack  

ethereum is composed by accounts  
transaction: a signatured data package send from an externally owned account  
crucial fields: startgas, gasprice  

transaction function: check whether the transaction is well-formed, calculate transaction fee, initialize gas, transfer the value; if failed, revert the changes  

code in ethereum is written for EVM  
the near-same way for mining as bitcoin  
applications for now and future  

(so, what did this solved...)
