# OSTEP 7

workload assumptions  
scheduling metrics: turn-around time  
FIFO will perform poorly as the first-in program occupy for a long turn-around time  
preemptive: decide to switch to which job before the job completed  

SJF cannot deal with the situation that the jobs don't arrive at the same time  
STCF, PSJF: deal the processes by their finishing time  

what if the time is unknown? use the response time to metric  
Round Robin: run the job due to the time slices  
amortize the cost of switching by lengthen time slices  
overlap: better use of resources
