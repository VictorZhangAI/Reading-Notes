complex is a macro for ``_Complex``, as: 
```C
double complex 4+5I;
```
creal(), cimag, cabs(), carg()  
in GNU C:
```C
__complex__ float a = 4 + 5i;
float b = __real__ a;
float c = __imag__ a;
```
``-fshort-enums`` for choosing smallest int type for enum  

in union:
not only ``f: 3.14``, but ``.f=3.14``  
large enough to hold largest number  
the addr of bitfield cannot be accessed by &  
struct is omit packed  
zero-length array could be used as the last element of a structure  
```C
int my_array[5] = { [2] 5, [4] 9 };
```
volatile: explicitly changable  
~: complex conjugation  
compound statement:
```C
({ int y = function (); int z;
if (y > 0) z = y;
else z = - y;
z; })
```
```C
//macro with type known
#define maxint(a,b) \
({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a > _b ? _a : _b; })
```
