# RedLeaf

Modified: 250207

researching on ways of isolation  
traditional approach: monolithic kernel, safe high-level language  
breaking the monolithic kernel leads to an opposite ending  
RedLeaf is built to isolate just based on a safe HLL  
However RL couldn't isolate faults just using Rust  
isolate the crash domain: unwind, deallocate  
enforce single ownership of objects  
generate proxies statically to avoid the run-time overhead  

Domains are restricted in safe rust  
proxies generated by IDL compiler  
least privilege, enable flexible  
each domain starts with a reference  

crash: one of the domain's threads panic  
global shared heap, remote reference  
objects allocated on shared heap could only compose of exchangable types  
invocation proxies  
check whether the domain is alive, create light continuations, move ownership, wrap all trait references  
zero-copy communications
