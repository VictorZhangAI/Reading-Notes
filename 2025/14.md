time-sharing: run, stop, run another  
policies: algorithms for OS making decisions  
Loading: Takes on-disk program and reads it into the address space of process  
loading process eagerly: all-at-once; lazily: loading pieces of data only as needed  
allocate for program's stack and heap  
block: a process giving other processes chance to run  
zombie: exited but not cleaned by GC
