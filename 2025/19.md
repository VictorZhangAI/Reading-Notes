How to schedule when the information of jobs is not clear?  
if priority of A is > B, run A; if = ; run in Round Robin  
MLFQ will try to learn history process and predict future jobs  

allotment: the amoumt time of a job to spend at a giveen priority before its priority decreases  
first-in: highest priority, use up allotment time: decrease priority, yield: stay the same priority  

problems: long processes will starve as short processes occupy CPU resources  
the algorithm is vulnerable to attacks  
a job could change its behavior  
solution: after some time, move all the jobs to the top priority  
regardless yielding, reduce priority level just when the allotment time uses up
