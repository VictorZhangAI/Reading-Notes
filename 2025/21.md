multi-core CPU requires program run in parallel  
multiprocessor scheduling  

cache coherence  
maintain correctness in lock-free data  
SQMS needs a lot of locks and cache affinity  
MQMS would performance even worse without a good schedule  
migration: let idle CPU has some job to do  
work stealing: steal work from high-loading queue to balance between queues
