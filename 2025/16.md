# OSTEP 6

Modified: 250212

performance and control remained as the challenges of time-sharing systems  
limited direct execution  
user mode: programs are limited to what they could do  
kernel mode: code could run as what it likes  
trap: jump into kernel mode; return-from-trap: jump back to the user mode  
trap table: decide whether cause a trap or not  

when switching between processes, the OS should regain the accessibility to the CPU  

the yield won't work if the program runs into an infinite loop  
use a timer-interrupt  

scheduler: decide whether run the current process or run another one  
reboot: return the whole system into a known and tested state  
timer interrupt occurs, save user registers by hardware, decided to switch, save kernel registers by software
