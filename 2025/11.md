# BitLocker

Modified: 250208

a new cipher cannot be trusted without many years of public review, and existing ciphers that satisfy the additional security requirements are either too slow or insufficiently analyzed  

AES-CBC method  
how to protect data on a lost computer?  
sealed against a series of PCR values  
authentication code is not reliable  
bitLocker is done in a per-sector basis  
unacceptable to re-write the sectors  

use poor-man's authentication as the first defense line  
The attacker succeeds if he can modify a ciphertext such that the corresponding plaintext change has some non-random property  
Bear and Lion approach, ..., are not suitable approach  
diffuser only need to make attacking harder
