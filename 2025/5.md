# Fault-Tolerant Virtual Machine

Modified: 250130  

common solution: backup the whole Virtual Machine, but require huge bandwidth  
sync deterministic state machine could require much less bandwidth  
virtual machine run on a hypervisor  
based on non-deterministic replay  
only attempt to deal with fail-stop behaviors  

keep in sync and execute identically: in virtual lock step  
combination of heartbeating and monitoring  
capture, apply, do in a manner  
event delievery mechanism  

Output requirement: execute in the entirely consistent way  
backup VM must know the way to replay the fault  
create a special log entry  
primary doesn't send until the backup VM has received  
output to the external world is delayed until the primary received the backup has known the log entry  
deal with incoming packets dropping  

the backup VM promoted as a primary VM  
know the MAC addr of primary VM  
may cause split-brain problem as the backup machine may not receive the heartbeat  
a cluster of backup, setup new backup VM to ensure the redundancy  
stop execution until log entry flushed out  
use a slow feedback loop to send execute message  
apply VMotion to record the disks  

generally detect I/O races, sequentially actions  
bounce buffers: same size as a memory being accessed by an operation  
code in VM will disable net async operation  
reduce the time to transmit message  
shared & non-shared disks: async; deal with two brain situation  

an efficient FTVM could be built using deterministic replay  
using many uni-processor not one multi-processor
