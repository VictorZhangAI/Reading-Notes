the degree of privilege escalation  
ways to prevent security problems from programming problems  
UNIX separated process for each program  
in UNIX, privileges are formed as a tree  
privilege separation is orthogonal to other ways of separation  
model the privilege-related action using FSM  
change the child's root to an empty directory, then modify UID and GID  
A child issues an informational request if acquiring the information requires privileges  
exporting all state of the unprivileged child process back to the monitor  
providing memory allocation from shared memory  

pre-authentication: exchange keys, exchange validated keys, validate users, authenticate passwords, public key authentication  

post-authentication: fork a new process, key exchange, pseudo terminal creation  
benefit from reusing critical security code
