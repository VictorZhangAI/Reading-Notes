# The BSD Packet Filter  

Modified: 250206  

packet filter is a kernel agent  
people always spend lots of time spliting and isolating networking problems  
current packet filter has poor performance  

network tap, filter  
not addressed to the localhost: interrupt, or continue processes  
collect data from several packets, return to monitor when it has a read request  

NIT is not aligned as BPF  
filter packets early and separated  
filtering way are equivalent  

CSPF: either push constants or packet data on the stack, or perform a binary boolean or bitwise operation on the top two elements  
expression-tree approach: maintaim a simulated stack, redundant operations  
inability to parse variable length packet headers  

putting a pseudo-language interpreter  
protocol independent, general, minimize data reference, AM reg resided in PM reg  

instructions & registers  
the way of parsing and executing
